# Project_Number_game
This is my first small project which basically a number guessing game and this is build using Python.
<br>
Game Description:
<br>
The Number Guessing Game is a simple Python program where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player attempts to guess it. The game begins with a welcoming message and the presentation of the randomly chosen number. The player inputs their guesses, and the program provides feedback, indicating whether the guess is too low or too high. The player continues guessing until the correct number is identified. The program tracks the number of attempts and congratulates the player upon a successful guess, revealing the total attempts made. It's a straightforward yet engaging introduction to basic Python programming and user interaction.

I have used simple while loop and decision making statement i.e., if..else to build this game.
